# investment-classification-recommender
Machine learning models to classify investment propensities and recommend financial products for banking clients.


# üß† Investment Classification & Recommendation System

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify 5000 bank clients based on their **income** and **accumulation investment** propensities. Based on the classification, a simple rule-based recommendation system assigns personalized financial products.

## üìå Problem Statement

Banks and fintech platforms often need to understand clients' investment behavior to personalize offerings. This project builds models to classify clients and recommend suitable financial products.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Binary classification for **IncomeInvestment** and **AccumulationInvestment**
- Supervised models: Logistic Regression, AdaBoost (with Perceptron and Decision Trees), Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Rule-based recommendation engine using predicted labels and client risk profiles

## üìä Results

### üü© Best Performing Model: Random Forest

| Target                         | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Income Investment Propensity  | 0.825    | 0.890     | 0.607  | 0.722    |
| Accumulation Investment       | 0.831    | 0.919     | 0.735  | 0.817    |

- Best Hyperparameters for Income:
  - `max_depth=12`, `n_estimators=125`, `min_samples_split=6`
- Best Hyperparameters for Accumulation:
  - `max_depth=10`, `n_estimators=125`, `min_samples_split=10`
